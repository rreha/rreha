  <h2>my goofy ahh projects</h2>
  <p>↳<a href="https://github.com/rreha/pyident">pyident</a>: my 2nd PSP homebrew in C (the 1st being reha's flash0 eboot launcher but that was a disaster so forget about it). it's basically a python pspIdent "clone" written in like 30 mins.</p>
  <p>↳<a href="https://github.com/rreha/psp-stackless-button-tester">psp-stackless-button-tester</a>: another basic homebrew written in python.</p>
  <p>↳<a href="https://github.com/rreha/luatoolbox">luatoolbox</a>: well well this one was about to be a decent PSP hardware testing homebrew but i stopped developing it further so it's half-baked. uses the onelua interpreter. some parts of it are still functional though.</p>
  <p>↳<a href="https://github.com/rreha/openspeed">OpenSpeed</a>: open source alternative for LightSpeed and DarkSpeed. TheZett is known for his closed source masterpieces... this program basically functions like those two programs but it's still in the alpha stage. STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!!!!</p>
  <p>↳<a href="https://github.com/rreha/spoofix">spoofix</a>: a program that automatically fixes the 9.90 issue on 5.50 cfws. i was about to add some really cool features to this app but Yoti just literally wanted me to cease the development of the project and showed his 12 year old homebrew as an evidence like he owns the patent of the idea. i mean i literally have full respects to Yoti and his contributions for the PSP scene but bro is literally making a vigintillionth clone of pspident. he ain't gotta come down on me like that...</p>
  <p>↳<a href="https://github.com/rreha/sg0-renpsp">STEINS;GATE 0 RenPSP</a>: this was basically my submission for the PSP Monthly Game Jam! #1 on itch.io which had a theme about love but my homebrew was in the 4th place. the Fruit Ninja port was above me so you can probably guess how fair the ratings were!!</p>
   <p>↳<a href="https://github.com/rreha/iypcwc">is your psp compatible with cIPL?</a>: simple ta-088v3 checker that me and PonpiK made for a turkish CFW installation guide which was never completed...</p>
  <p>↳<a href="https://github.com/rreha/noumd">NoUMD Rewrite</a>: this project made me and PonpiK learn how to properly code PSP plugins</p>
